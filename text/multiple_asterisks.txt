Your "match" text contains multiple consecutive asterisks (eg. "**") which will probably be slow and not do what you expect.

Asterisks in normal (ie. not regular expression) triggers or aliases represent a wildcard - that is, to match anything in the source text.

Putting two in a row doesn't make a huge amount of sense, you are matching <anything><anything>.

This will slow down the matching routine as it tries lots of combinations. For example, a trigger or alias matching: "**" and given the text "abcdef" would try these combinations:

Wildcard 1: a
Wildcard 2: bcdef

then

Wildcard 1: ab
Wildcard 2: cdef

then

Wildcard 1: abc
Wildcard 2: def

and so on, posssibly taking a long time if the text to be scanned is long.

The wildcards should be at least separated by some other character, eg. "* *" would be OK, however if you are trying to matching something like this:

*** You are stunned

... then you need to use a regular expression, because then you can "escape" out the asterisk with a backslash, thus making it a "normal" asterisk, and not a wildcard.

For example the above line ("*** You are stunned") could be matched by:

Match: ^\*\*\* You are stunned$
Regular expression: checked

The backslash "escapes" the special meaning of the asterisk, the "^" means "start of line" and the "$" means "end of line".
