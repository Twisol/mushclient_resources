Installer
---------

The installer for MUSHclient was created using the NSIS installer from NullSoft.

You can read about it at:

  http://www.nullsoft.com/


UPX
---

MUSHclient is compressed with UPX, so that the executable file is compact, and thus will fit onto a single floppy disk.

UPX is a free, portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for several different executable formats. It achieves an excellent compression ratio and offers very fast decompression. Your executables suffer no memory overhead or other drawbacks.

UPX was written by Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar. You can read about it at:

  http://upx.sourceforge.net/


Scripting Engines
-----------------

VBScript and JScript technologies supplied by Microsoft Corporation.

PerlScript and Python are available from ActiveState - see their web site at:

For information about Lua, see below ...


Lua
---

The Lua language is designed and implemented at Tecgraf, PUC-Rio in Brazil by the team below: 

  Roberto Ierusalimschy 
  Ph.D. in Computer Science, PUC-Rio, 1990. 
  Associate Professor at Computer Science Department, PUC-Rio. 

  Waldemar Celes 
  Ph.D. in Computer Science, PUC-Rio, 1995. 
  Associate Professor at Computer Science Department, PUC-Rio. Area coordinator at Tecgraf. 

  Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo 
  D.Sc. in Mathematics, IMPA, 1992. 
  Associate Researcher at IMPA. Consultant at Tecgraf.

FIGlet
------

Frank, Ian and Glenn's LETters - this is the source of the "ASCII Art" function in the inbuilt Notepad. 

FIGlet was written by Ian Chai, Glenn Gilford Chappell, John Cowan and Paul Burton, and is used with permission.

You can get many fonts which are not in the basic FIGlet package from the Web site:

  http://www.figlet.org/ 

It should also contain the latest version of FIGlet and other utilities related to FIGlet.


MUD Client Compression Protocol (MCCP)
--------------------------------------

MUSHclient detects servers which use the MUD Client Compression Protocol (MCCP) and automatically switches to compressed mode. Read more about MCCP at:

  http://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/

  (note - this page seems to be down currently)


MUD Extension Protocol (MXP)
----------------------------

MUSHclient processes the Mud eXtension Protocol (MXP) which is an HTML-like markup language for MUD output.

MXP was initially designed by Michael Potter (Zugg) who has been very helpful in clarifying and amplifying upon the original spec.

MXP is described at:

  http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/mxp.htm

There a considerable amount of detail about MUSHclient's MXP implementation at:

  http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/bbshowpost.php?bbtopic_id=33

Development of MXP has been greatly assisted by the support of Michael Garratt (Kalahn), developer of the Dawn Of Time codebase (DOT), which is available from:

  http://www.dawnoftime.org/


Pueblo
------

MUSHclient will recognise the tags sent by a Pueblo-enabled world (which are very similar to MXP).

Pueblo is the trademark of Chaco Communications, Inc.

ZLIB compression algorithm
--------------------------

MUD Client Compression Protocol uses the 'zlib' general purpose compression library, version 1.1.3, July 9th, 1998.

ZLIB was written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

  Jean-loup Gailly <jloup@gzip.org>
  Mark Adler <madler@alumni.caltech.edu>

The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the URLS:

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1950.html  (zlib format)
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1951.html  (deflate format)
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1952.html  (gzip format)


More information about zlib can be obtained from:

  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/


zLib is also used in the compress and decompress utilities which are part of the Lua library.

Levenshtein Distance Algorithm
------------------------------

C++ Implementation by Anders Sewerin Johansen.


Commented softcode
------------------

The suggested enhancements for sending commented softcode to a MUSH were made by Andrew Gray.


Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions
-----------------------------------

This is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Regular Expression extension for Lua

Arbitrary precision numbers
---------------------------

The "big numbers" library was written by Philip A. Nelson of the Computer Science Department, Western Washington University, Bellingham, WA.

The big-number library for Lua 5.0 (based on GNU bc-1.06 core library) was written by Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo.


MUSHclient Icon
---------------

The MUSHclient icon was designed by Brandon Blackmoor. It was improved, and a larger one for Windows XP done, by Neva.


Wine
----

MUSHclient will hopefully run under Wine these days (ie. under Linux with Wine installed). Thanks to Harold Jones for encouraging me to make the necessary changes and helping with setting up Wine under Linux. To work properly under Wine you need to use the "/wine" command-line switch. This disables certain things (like scripting) that don't work properly under Wine at present. However, Lua scripting is available under Wine regardless of the /wine setting. For more details about Wine, see:

Alt-key suppression
-------------------

Code for suppressing Alt-key menu behaviour supplied by Pink Olifaunt.


History of MUDs
---------------

The world of MUDs is a co-operative effort by many people. For a very interesting history of MUDs (and the Internet in general) see the paper "Cultural Formations in Text-Based Virtual Realities" by Elizabeth M. Reid at:
